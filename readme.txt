I always have a hard time finding my flint and tinder when it's time to fire up the ol' Goblin Barbecue and cook up some tasty treats. (Yeah, they say you don't even need it anymore, but I'm old fashioned.) But I never have trouble finding my cookbook. (Ask any goblin engineer or alchemist how important it is to follow recipes precisely and they'll tell you it's serious business. They'll be even more serious about it the fewer fingers they have.)

And so, my greatest culinary invention yet! (Even better than bagel holes, chocolate-flavored vanilla, and Flerberts.) This handy gizmo clips right on to the side of your cookbook: flick the little wheel, and BAM -- you've got fire for cooking! It even has a safety so you won't accidentally incinerate your cookbook, yourself, your friends, or Mount Hyjal. Probably.

INSTALLATION: Put this folder into your World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and launch WoW.

FEATURES:
- Adds a button for Basic Fire to the side of the Cooking window.
- If you have other types of cooking fire available, the button can use them instead of Basic Fire:
	- Alternate fires include Lil' Ragnaros, Little Wickerman, and Grim Campfire.
	- If any of these is available, ZippyLighter will use it by default.
	- Hold ALT while mousing over the cooking fire button to change which gets used.
